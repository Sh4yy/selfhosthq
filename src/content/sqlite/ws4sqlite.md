# Deploying a SQLite database with ws4sqlite

ws4sqlite is a server-side application that creates a REST API for interacting with SQLite databases. It basically converts SQLite into a REST API that you can interact with using HTTP requests.

It makes it easy to use SQLite over a remote connection, for example, from a serverless function or directly from a client-side application.

## Installing ws4sqlite

ws4sqlite is a Go application which you can download the binary directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite/releases) page, or build from source.

## Running ws4sqlite

Once you have downloaded or built ws4sqlite, you can run your server and create a new SQLite database.

```bash
❯ ./ws4sqlite --db selfhost.db  # [!code focus]

ws4sqlite v0.16.1, based on sqlite v3.45.2
- Serving database 'selfhost' from selfhost.db?_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)
  + No valid config file specified, using defaults
  + File not present, it will be created
  + Using WAL
- Web Service listening on 0.0.0.0:12321
```

With our server up and running, we can now start interacting with our SQLite database over the network.

### Creating a table

To perform a SQL query or statement, all we need to do is send a POST request to the `/<database>` endpoint with the SQL statement in the body.

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:12321/selfhost"
payload = {
    "transaction": [
        {
            "statement": """
                CREATE TABLE USERS (
                    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(50),
                    LAST_NAME VARCHAR(50)
                );
            """
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
```

On success, the response will be a 200 status code with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "rowsUpdated": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Inserting data

Similarly, to insert data into our `USERS` table, we can send a POST request to the `/<database>` endpoint with the SQL statement in the body.

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:12321/selfhost"
payload = {
    "transaction": [
        {
            "statement": """
                INSERT INTO USERS (ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)
                VALUES (:id, :first_name, :last_name)
            """,
            "values": {
                "id": 1,
                "first_name": "John",
                "last_name": "Doe"
            }
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```

On success, the response will be a 200 status code with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "rowsUpdated": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Querying data

Finally, to query data from our `USERS` table, we can send another POST request with a `query` transaction.

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:12321/selfhost"
payload = {
    "transaction": {
      "query": {
        "statement": "SELECT * FROM USERS;"
      }
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```

On success, the response will be a 200 status code with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "resultHeaders": ["ID", "FIRST_NAME", "LAST_NAME"],
      "resultSet": [
        {
          "ID": 1,
          "FIRST_NAME": "John",
          "LAST_NAME": "Doe"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it! We've created a SQLite database, created a table, inserted data, and queried data.

## Authentication

A common use case for ws4sqlite is to expose a SQLite database over a remote connection. This opens up the ability to interact with the database from a remote client, such as a serverless function or a client-side application.

To make sure we're not exposing our database to the public, we can use basic authentication. Luckily, ws4sqlite has built-in support for basic authentication. Let's enable it and require authentication for all requests.

### Defining users

To define users, we need to create a new config file, and then update it to define the users.

In ws4sqlite, we can define config files by creating a `.yaml` file with the same name as the database. For example, if we're using the `selfhost.db` database, we can create a `selfhost.yaml` file.

```yaml
auth:
  mode: HTTP
  byCredentials:
    - user: user1
      password: password
```

This will create a new user called `user1` with the password `password`. Now, we can simply run our server again, and it will automatically use the new config file.

```bash
❯ ./ws4sqlite --db selfhost.db # [!code focus]

ws4sqlite v0.16.1, based on sqlite v3.45.2
- Serving database 'selfhost' from selfhost.db?_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)
  + Parsed companion config file: selfhost.yaml
  + Using WAL
  + Authentication enabled, with 1 credential
- Web Service listening on 0.0.0.0:12321
```

Now, to run queries against our database, we will have to pass the username and password as basic authentication credentials.

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:12321/selfhost"
payload = {
    "transaction": {
      "query": {
        "statement": "SELECT * FROM USERS;"
      }
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, auth=("user1", "password"))
print(response.json())
```

On success, the response will be a 200 with the same JSON body as before. If we were to pass the wrong credentials, the response will be a 401 Unauthorized status code.

### Hashing passwords

Additionally, ws4sqlite supports hashing passwords. This is a good practice to use when storing passwords instead of plain text.

To do this, we can simply replace the `password` field with `hashedPassword` in our config file and provide a SHA-256 hashed password.

```bash
❯ echo -n "password" | sha256sum # [!code focus]

5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8  -
```

```yaml
auth:
  mode: HTTP
  byCredentials:
    - user: user1
      password: password
    - user: user2
      hashedPassword: 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8
```

Now, we can run our server again, and this time pass the hashed username and password as basic authentication credentials.

## Backups

When running any database, it's important to ensure that we have regular database backups in case of any issues. There are multiple ways to backup a SQLite database, and fortunately, ws4sqlite has built-in support for this.

To schedule a backup, we need to head back to our `selfhost.yaml` file, and schedule a backup task.

```yaml
auth: // ...
scheduledTasks:
  - schedule: "1 * * * *" # Every hour
    doBackup: true
    backupTemplate: ./backups/dump_%s.db
    numFiles: 3
```

This will schedule a backup task to run every hour, store the backups in the `./backups` directory, and keep the last 3 backups. Of course, you may adjust the schedule, backup template, and number of files to meet your needs.

### Restoring from a backup

To restore from a backup, we can simply copy the backup file to the database file, and run our server again.

```bash
❯ ./ws4sqlite --db selfhost.db # [!code focus]
```

## Conclusion

ws4sqlite is a powerful tool that allows you to expose a SQLite database over a remote connection. It's a good choice for running a SQLite database in a serverless environment, or for running a SQLite database in a client-side application.
