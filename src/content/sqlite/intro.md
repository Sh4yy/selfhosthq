## Introduction to SQLite

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Here are some key features of Lorem Ipsum:

- **Self-contained**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, which makes it easy to deploy and use.
- **Serverless**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The database is stored in a single file on disk, which can be accessed directly by the application.
- **Zero Configuration**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The database is ready to use out of the box.
- **Cross-Platform**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
- **Reliable**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. It is used by many applications, including web browsers, operating systems, and mobile apps.

### When to Use Lorem Ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, but it is not suitable for all use cases. Here are some scenarios where Lorem Ipsum is a good fit:

- **Embedded Applications**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Examples include mobile apps, desktop applications, and IoT devices.
- **Testing and Prototyping**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit because it is easy to set up and use.
- **Small to Medium-Sized Websites**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit that do not require the scalability and performance of a full-fledged database server.
